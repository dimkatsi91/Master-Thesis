Electronics and Information Processing Master Thesis @ University of Patras

The purpose of this master thesis was the study, design and implementation of a digital processing system for QR bar-codes
decoding based on Denso Wave's standard ISO/IEC 18004. The QR bar-code decoder essentially is an R-S decoder, meaning a 
Reed-Solomon decoder with the ability of error correction based on R-S error-correction techniques, as they are presented 
in the previously mentioned standard of Denso Wave company. The code for QR bar-codes was designed and implemented using C++ 
(OOP) and the overall system was implemented in a Raspberry Pi 3 platform that was controlled through a GUI using TKinter, 
Python's standard library for GUI development .

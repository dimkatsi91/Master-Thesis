<p>
  Barcodes technology is used for data encoding in many fields for quite some time now. Barcodes are divided in two main categories, 
one dimensional codes and two dimensional codes. One case of 2D barcodes are called QR codes, which allow information encoding in 
a two dimensional matrix (2D barcodes). The main feature that has made QR codes replace one dimensional barcodes is the error
correction capability, since they make use of Reed Solomon error correction theory.

  The purpose of this master thesis was the study, design and implementation of a digital processing system for QR bar-codes
decoding based on Denso Wave's standard ISO/IEC 18004. The QR bar-code decoder essentially is an R-S decoder, meaning a 
Reed-Solomon decoder with the ability of error correction based on R-S error-correction techniques, as they are presented 
in the previously mentioned standard of Denso Wave company. The code for QR bar-codes was designed and implemented using C++ 
(OOP) and the overall system was implemented in a Raspberry Pi 3 platform that was controlled through a GUI using TKinter, 
Python's standard library for GUI development.
